# VII. Resources & Technical Tutorials

## A. Email Policies

### - Policies for Sending Secure Data
When sending secure data through email, it must always be encrypted to comply with UCSF's data protection policies. Sensitive data includes patient information, genomic data, or any other confidential research information. To encrypt your email, include the prefix “secure:” at the beginning of the subject line of your email. Always use encrypted email services when handling sensitive data. UCSF business should never be conducted using personal email accounts regardless of the sensitivity level of data being shared.

### - What Counts as Secure Data:
- **Protected health information (PHI)** includes “any information in the medical record or designated record set that can be used to identify an individual and that was created, used, or disclosed in the course of providing a health care service such as diagnosis or treatment.”
- Review the 18 identifiers that qualify as PHI [here](https://cphs.berkeley.edu/hipaa/hipaa18.html)
- **Genomic and Medical Data**: Any raw genomic sequence or clinical information.
- **Sensitive Research Data**: Unpublished results, intellectual property, or confidential reports. To ensure proper handling of this data, consult UCSF's data privacy guidelines.

## B. Slack

### 1. Access
Alexis Oddi or Ana Tyler will provide access to the Laboyama Slack workspace. New users must first create a Slack account and will receive a prompt to do so when they receive the Slack workspace invitation via email.

### 2. Channels
- `#general`: Broad updates for the whole lab, important announcements, and general lab-wide communication.
- `#labmeeting`: Used for coordinating lab meetings, agendas, and sharing updates from those meetings.
- `#random`: For casual conversations, off-topic discussions, and non-work-related sharing.
- `#technical-tips`: A place for sharing and discussing technical issues, software, or tools relevant to lab operations and troubleshooting.
- `#data-science-group`: Focused on data science discussions, including statistical methods, coding issues, and analysis techniques.
- `#wet_lab_interest_group`: Discussions related to wet lab techniques, protocols, and relevant experimental updates.

### 3. Policies
- **Who Can Be a Member?**: Only active lab members, collaborators, and invited partners can access the workspace.
- **What Type of Data Can You Put in Slack?**: No sensitive data (like patient information) should ever be shared on Slack. Use encrypted email for secure communications, or Box for secure file sharing.

## C. Box

### 1. Where is the main Lab Box Drive?
The main Box drive for the Yokoyama Lab is hosted on UCSF’s Box server. It can be accessed at [UCSF Box](https://box.ucsf.com)

### 2. What is the Structure?
The current structure follows this layout:
- `/Freezerworks`
- `/Lab Manual`
- `/Data Access`
- `/Presentations`
- `/Rotation Projects`
- `/Onboarding`
- `/Finances`
- `/Grant Tracker`
- `/IRB`
- `/Pictures`

## D. Shared Genetics Drive & Seqdata

### 1. How Do You Access the Shared Genetics Drive?
You need a UCSF active directory account to access shared genetics drives. Permissions are granted by the PI.

### 2. How Do You Access Seqdata?
Seqdata is located under `/wynton/group/yokoyama/seqdata` on UCSF's high-performance computing cluster (Wynton). You will need a Wynton account to access it.

## E. Genetics Virtual Machines (VMs)
Please find all information about VMs [here](https://github.com/YOKOYAMA-UCSF/GeneralJobAids/blob/main/Yokoyama_servers.pdf)
## F. Wynton
Please find all information about UCSF Wynton [here](https://wynton.ucsf.edu/hpc/index.html).

## G. GitHub
How to Use GitHub: Version control in the lab is done using GitHub repositories. Lab members are expected to push their code regularly and document changes.

## H. Zotero
How to Use Zotero: please check their website [here](https://www.zotero.org/support/quick_start_guide).
