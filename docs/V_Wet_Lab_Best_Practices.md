# V. Wet Lab Best Practices


## A. Wet Lab Operations

### 1. Materials

#### i. To place an order for materials and reagents, please create a cart in BearBuy and assign it to the Lab Manager with required items included and an approved speedtype. For assistance, please see here. For an approved speedtype, please consult your funding source and PI regarding your specific project.

Shipping address:
[Your name here]  
Weill Institute for Neurosciences  
1651 4th Street  
San Francisco, CA 94158  
Room 421A  

#### ii. Ordered items to be received will be shipped to the location specified on the purchase order. Those who are requesting materials and reagents for order will be responsible for obtaining tracking information, to track and receive packages for appropriate storage.

Help is available! Please reach out to Lab Manager if assistance with tracking and receiving is required to ensure efficient workflow.

Upon receiving of all materials and reagents, please mark in pen the received date and initials. Example:  
Rec: 8.7.24 TJ

#### iii. Materials used and shared in high frequency will require diligent accounting to ensure sufficient volume and/or quantity, within expiration, for the next user. Please utilize the below table, printed, and posted in lab space for this purpose. To ensure communal items are available for those who need them, when they need them, the following protocol will need to be adhered to by all personnel.

The first mode of accounting to ensure reagents and materials are in place for a project will include preparing a protocol and confirming materials and reagents are in place in enough advance to place an order for delivery. In the case others are also using this material or reagent, the second mode of accounting will be the review of the check list supplied below in section 3.A.iii. The third mode of accounting will come in the form of effective communication between lab members.

Funding source will dictate personal versus communal use of materials and reagents.

Once an item has been used, please mark:  
- Reagent tubes, vials, etc.: penned black dot on lid  
- Boxes: penned date, initials  
- Conical tube packs: penned date, initials  

Please work to maintain as clean of environment as possible by rolling and wrapping up conical tube packs containing unused tubes, sealed with lab tape.

Example:  
Rec: 8.7.24 TJ  
Opened: 8.8.24 TJ  

To promote and maintain an effective RNase-free environment, all lab members will be responsible for ensuring:
- Tip boxes are closed
- Centrifuge covers are replaced before closing lid and shutting down
- Ice buckets are reasonably cleaned and sanitized
- Water droplets are removed from cold blocks
- Be mindful of touching inside of lids, tubes, pipette tips
- Make aliquots of RNase-free water before use, and make sure to replace source of RNase-free water after routine use, or after long periods of no use
- Return shared items to their original location after use
- Adhering to a neat and clean policy outlined below:

Before bench work, benches must be first cleaned and then sanitized using 70% ethanol to at minimum mitigate RNase activity, made using 200 proof ethanol diluted into MilliQ water. During bench work, please be mindful of dust, moving hands, pipettes, etc. over open tubes, talking in the direction of open tube. Please also periodically spray hands with 70% ethanol to promote mindful cleanliness at the bench.

### 2. Waste disposal

#### iv. Biological waste is to be disposed of according to Biosafety, Bloodborne Pathogens, Carcinogens, and Lab Safety for Researchers training which can be found in the UC Learning Center in MyAccess. Additional information can be found through UCSF EH&S.

When a biosafety bin is full, please either (i) remove from bin, twist-tie closed, and drop off at communal pick-up location outside room 422J, or (ii) notify Lab Manager.

#### v. Chemical waste is to be disposed of according to Carcinogens and Lab Safety for Researchers training which can be found in the UC Learning Center in MyAccess. Additional information can be found through UCSF EH&S.

When working with chemicals known to be hazardous, please confine use to Chemical fume hood and clearly label waste container, placed in secondary containment. When a chemical waste container is full, please either (i) create a new tag for pick up via WASTe in MyAccess, label container, and request pick up, or (ii) notify Lab Manager. Additional information can be found at UCSF EH&S.

#### vi. Recycling of lab consumables is available for clear plastics, colored plastics, and gloves. These bins are located outside room 422M. Requirements for recycling are posted on these bins. Please use labeled “Clear”, and “Color” beakers for each bench to facilitate easy and clean recycling. For more information, please see Polycarbin Services.

## B. Wet Lab Procedures

Projects that involve collaboration on projects must use wet-lab folder in Box so all members can have access to the following information (samples used, protocol, experiment file, data, summary of results), concisely stored and organized within a single folder. Additional information regarding data generation and storage for sequencing experiments ONLY can be referenced in Yokoyama Lab: Dry Lab Best Practices.docx.

### 1. Samples

#### i. Acquisition
For details surrounding sample acquisition, please see both Yokoyama Lab phlebotomy draw collection SOP.docx and Yokoyama PBMC and Banking Protocol.docx

#### ii. Storage
For details surrounding sample storage, please see FreezerWorks Sample Management SOP.docx

#### iii. Request
Sample requests must be approved by Lab Supervisor and run through the appropriate workflow as outlined below.

1. The requester must fill out the Yokoyama Lab Sample Request Form.docx and submit to Lab Associate via email, which will be stored long-term in Sample request folder.
2. Lab Associate will follow up with sample manifest to confirm selection and provide additional aliquot-level information to be stored in experiment folder.
3. Lab Associate will pull samples for use depending on stated “Date samples are required” and either (i) handed off for use day-of, or (ii) temporarily stored at -80°C for pickup by requestor. In the case of option (ii), samples should be stored at -80°C for no more than ~3 days (e.g., they can be taken out of LN2 on a Friday for use on the following Monday).

#### iv. Use
Data on any sample derivatives (DNA, RNA, protein, lysate, cDNA, library, etc.) generated via experimental work will be recorded and logged in FreezerWorks and will require a unique vial label to printed and applied to sample tube. Please see FreezerWorks Sample Management SOP.docx for more information.

### 2. Protocol (.docx)
All actions to take place at bench or tissue culture hood utilizing samples acquired and stored by the Yokoyama Lab will require a coherent, thorough protocol before use. This protocol will serve as the written reference for each experiment for all actions undertaken at the bench or hood and will be utilized by both you and your colleagues to replicate, troubleshoot, and reference for all project needs in the future.

It is imperative that this protocol be located within the same folder as your experiment sheet (see section 4.C) and generated data (see section 4.D). To provide the appropriate context, all protocols require the following information formatted as first lines on first page:
- “Protocol” – Title of experiment
- Date: ____________________
- Project: ____________________
- Methods: ____________________
- Cell type: ____________________
- Targets: ____________________
- Data generated: ____________________

In the spirit of minimizing required work to design and develop a protocol. We encourage referencing of established protocols from kits used in the experiment, within your personal experiment protocol, noting any modifications necessary. This ensures that no unintended edits were made when copying over an established protocol, minimizes the amount of work required, and importantly allows those assessing the protocol to utilize their knowledge of the established protocol to more efficiently review, understand modifications and edits, and provide feedback.

### 3. Experiment file (.xlsx)
All actions to take place at bench or tissue culture hood utilizing samples acquired and stored by the Yokoyama Lab will require a coherent, thoroughly documented experiment file before use. This experiment file will serve as the reference for calculated values for each experiment for all actions undertaken at the bench or hood and will be utilized by both you and your colleagues to replicate, troubleshoot, and reference for all project needs in the future.

It is imperative that all experiment files contain a minimum of the following sheets to facilitate efficient organization and understanding of the experiment file at hand:
- Materials – Material name, supplier, product number, notes, etc.
- Samples – PIDN, Specimen date, aliquot ID, etc.
- Experiment (may be multiple separate sheets)
  - MACS separation (e.g., containing cell counts before and after purification)
  - RNA extraction (e.g., containing sample concentrations, volumes, yields, RINs)
  - Library preparation (e.g., containing concentrations, sizes)
  - ddPCR (e.g., containing all volumes pipetted, sample IDs, probe sets)
  - ddPCR plate (make a logical plate layout)
  - Antibody dilutions (e.g., what final dilutions did you use AND how did you prepare them)
  - Etc.
- QA/QC – Input quantities, dilutions, final concentrations, quality measures
- Results – A summary of results referenced from files exported from experiment and saved in same respective experiment sheet.
  - Doesn’t need to be a comprehensive analysis, but it is very helpful to provide a high-level summary of what the outcome of the experiment was

### 4. Data storage & analysis
Data generated via experiment methods will be stored within the experiment folder that houses the respective experiment protocols. Any modified iterations of the raw data used for analysis will require an additional file to be created to preserve raw data for future use.

- For example, it is good practice to create a new excel file for analyzing ddPCR output data and leaving the raw csv files exported from the reader unaltered.
