# VI. New Hire Tasks

## A. Required Training

### 1. Compliance and Safety Training:
- New hires must complete mandatory UCSF safety training, including Biosafety, Chemical Safety, Bloodborne Pathogens, Safe Shipper, and Carcinogen Training. This is required for those who will be handling hazardous materials or working in the wet lab. Certificates of completion should be saved and included in the regulatory binder.
- Specific training is available at the UC Learning Center ([link](https://learningcenter.ucsfmedicalcenter.org/)), including:
  - HIPAA 101
  - UC Cyber Security Awareness
  - Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment Prevention
  - UCSF Foundations of Diversity, Equality, and Inclusion

### 2. Research Ethics and Integrity:
- All personnel must complete CITI Human Subjects Protection Training and Good Clinical Practice (GCP). This is mandatory for research coordinators, faculty, fellows, and anyone with patient contact. Training can be accessed via the IRB UCSF website ([link](http://irb.ucsf.edu/citi-human-subjects-training)).

### 3. Wet Lab Trainings:
- Biosafety
- Bloodborne Pathogens
- Lab Safety for Researchers
- Safe Shipper - Biohazards (Only required if they will have shipping role as defined in BUA)
- Carcinogen
- Safety and Security Awareness for Researchers
- LHAT ([link](https://ehs.ucsf.edu/laboratory-coat-requests-new-researchers#))
  - i. Person must be added to LHAT before they may access training
  - ii. After completion, PPE will be available to coordinate pick-up
- CITI human subjects protection training ([link](https://irb.ucsf.edu/citi-human-subjects-training))
- Hepatitis B survey: [link](https://ohshepbsurvey.ucs)
- Email Taylor to submit BUA modification to add person to BUA
- After trainings have been completed:
  - Email Alexis to submit IRB modification for genetics on iRIS
  - If Jen says that the new hire will work on other projects: Shireen can add personnel to Redlat, for ADRC ask Harli Grant.

### 4. Data Management:
- As part of your onboarding, you will complete online modules reviewing UCSF’s policies for secure data storage, sharing, and security. Trainings are available through the UC Learning Center and other relevant platforms. Special focus should be placed on the handling of protected health information (PHI).
- If your work requires access to the Neurosciences Clinical Research Unit (NCRU), Kristen Fox (kristen.fox@ucsf.edu) will be contacted on your behalf to coordinate an NCRU orientation for you.

### 5. Lab-Specific Software Training:
- Depending on assigned projects, new hires may require additional training in specific tools such as GitHub, RStudio, or Wynton HPC.

### 6. Updates:
- Ensure that training certificates, bio updates, and system access are kept up to date.

## B. Important Accounts

### 1. UCSF Active Directory (AD) Account:
- New hires will be assigned a UCSF Active Directory account to access UCSF systems, including email, shared drives, secure data storage, and specialized systems such as Wynton and Box.
- The AD account is also necessary for login access to many UCSF resources. Requests for new accounts for new hires are made via PeopleConnect.

### 2. Box:
- Box can be accessed through your UCSF MyAccess account.
- UCSF's cloud storage system, Box, is used for all collaborative data management and sharing. New hires will be given access to specific folders like the Yokoyama Shared Drive by Alexis.
- Sensitive data, especially PHI, must be stored and shared according to UCSF policies.

### 3. Slack:
- Alexis or Ana will invite new lab members to join our Slack workspace.
- Slack is used for day-to-day communication within the lab.
- Data containing PHI or sensitive information must never be posted on Slack.

### 4. Wynton Account:
- Wynton HPC is the High-Performance Computing Cluster used for large-scale data analysis. A Wynton account should be requested for those needing access to perform bioinformatics work or computational analysis. Jen must approve access for the group folder.

### 5. GitHub Account:
- All personnel must maintain a GitHub account for version control and collaboration. The lab uses private repositories to manage project code and workflows.
- Once hired, team members will be invited to join lab repositories and given access based on their role.
- A new Github account can be created here: [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)

### 6. MACipedia:
- New hires needing access to MACipedia (the knowledge base for shared resources, protocols, and publications at the Memory and Aging Center) should first attempt to login to MACipedia via the link: [http://tiny.ucsf.edu/MACipedia](http://tiny.ucsf.edu/MACipedia)
- Then, if you receive a message that you do not have access, contact Caroline Prioleau (caroline.prioleau@ucsf.edu) for an account setup.

### 7. Zotero:
- New hires needing access to Zotero (platform for managing publications and references) may ask for access from Luke Bonham (luke.bonham@ucsf.edu).

### 8. Additional Accounts:
- Other accounts and access points (e.g., LAVA, genetics VMs, genetics shared drive) will be created as needed. The MAC Account Request Form (ARF) is submitted by Alexis to handle many of these.

## C. First Day Tasks

### 1. Badge Appointment:
- Ana or Alexis can help schedule a badge appointment with UCPD for lab and MAC space access. Once the badge is picked up, confirm that door access is functioning within 15 minutes for Sandler Neuroscience Center and Weill’s 3rd and 4th floors (codes MBNS01, C00421, C00215). If you have door access issues after this, contact Ana for further help.

### 2. IT Setup:
- Set up computer access, install the necessary software, and configure user accounts (including Box, Wynton, and GitHub).
- Alexis can help make an IT appointment through the UCSF Desktop Support system.

### 3. Introductory Meeting:
- Ana will set up introductory meetings with Jen, as well as introductory meetings with lab members, collaborators, and other colleagues during the new hire’s first few weeks.

### 4. Workplace Setup:
- Valerie will assist with ergonomic desk setup, printing codes, and additional office resources.

### 5. Virtual Machine Setup:
Managing Your login: Your user account and credentials are managed by the mac-internal.ucsf.edu Kerberos/LDAP directory. You can manage your password using this URL (you must accept the insecure web server key): [https://idm1.mac-internal.ucsf.edu](https://idm1.mac-internal.ucsf.edu)  
Accessing Servers via ssh: `ssh username@10.55.253.71` (for nsmaclyok1)  
More information about this in Chapter VII - Resources

### 6. Access to MAC Resources:
- New hires will be added to the MAC website and relevant mailing lists. Ana will add new hires, fellows, rotating students, visiting scholars, etc., to lab meetings and other lab events as appropriate, and Alexis will add them to interest group meetings and shared software tools as appropriate.

## D. Continuing Support and Resources

### 1. Ongoing Support:
- **Slack**: communication and collaboration platform designed to streamline teamwork. It operates as a hub where conversations are organized into channels, allowing teams to keep discussions focused on specific topics, projects, or departments (e.g., wet_lab_interest_group, data-science-group, general, etc). Slack supports real-time messaging, file sharing, and integrations with a wide array of productivity tools, such as Google Drive, Jira, and Asana, making it easy to manage tasks and projects within the same space. It also offers features like direct messaging, video and audio calls, and a robust search function to easily locate past conversations, pin messages, and documents. Our lab uses it for instant communication and sharing resources in the different channels described in the next chapter.
- **MACipedia** - Described in Chapter VII - Resources
- New hires can access technical support through tools like the Lab Tools and Educational Resources spreadsheet and GitHub General Job Aids.

### 2. Workflows:
- Additional access requests for computing or software environments, such as Wynton HPC or Bear Buy, can be submitted after the first week.
