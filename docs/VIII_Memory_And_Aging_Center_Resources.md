## B. LAVA
The Memory and Aging Center's central database of patient clinical research data.

## C. LAVA Query 5
Browser-based application for querying MAC data and linking tables into larger datasets for further analysis.

## D. MACPie
Command line based tool designed to perform date proximity data linking with Excel/CSV files not available in LavaQuery.

## G. Brainsight: VBM Analysis
A browser-based alternative to the SPM GUI, designed to streamline voxel-based morphometry analyses of structural atrophy patterns across groups of MAC patients, allowing submission of multiple concurrent analyses and permutation testing in the cloud, with review and comparison of VBM results directly in the browser.

## H. rtemisLIVE
All-purpose statistical tool based in R-Shiny to use for rapid data analysis, visualization, and machine learning.

## I. MAC Diagnostic Form
The dashboards to access the PPG, ADRC, and Hillblom online diagnostic schema.
