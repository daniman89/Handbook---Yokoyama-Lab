# III. General Policies and Expectations

## A. Shared Expectations

### 1. Lab Meetings

All lab members are expected to attend weekly, in-person lab meetings. Everyone who participates in research activities is expected to be a part of the presentation rotation. 

**There are three primary goals of lab meetings:**
1. Discuss pertinent lab business, including lab announcements, upcoming events, new publications, and issues that require group feedback.
2. Learn together as a lab.
3. Help the presenter improve their science and presentation skills.

- **When**: Weekly on Monday from 4:10 PM to 5:30 PM  
- **Where**: Weill Room 368 (usually)  
- **Who**: All lab members, former students, close collaborators, and occasional special guests are invited.  

You can sign up to present at any available lab meeting date [here](#). If you need to change your presentation date, please contact Ana as soon as possible.

**What to present:**  
The presenter is expected to prepare a PowerPoint presentation for the lab meeting on a topic relevant to the lab. Suggestions include:  
- Presenting current research progress.
- Practicing an upcoming presentation.
- Demonstrating a useful online tool that benefits the lab.
- Presenting a paper that others in the lab will find interesting/helpful.
- Creating a tutorial for a technique that others may not know how to perform.
- Discussing a grant/paper being written.
- Brainstorming ideas for a project under development.  

You can view past presentations (slides and recorded talks) on our Yokoyama Shared Drive on Box.

### 2. Working Hours & Time Off

Lab members are responsible for their role in projects and are expected to set reasonable goals and expectations for themselves.  
- Establish a regular schedule and be present in the lab during core hours (9 AM to 5 PM).  
- Prioritize your tasks to meet milestones and deadlines.  
- Coordinate schedules in advance for collaborations.  

If you require time off, please inform Jen and relevant team members as early as possible. Time off requests should be submitted to Jen via email.

### 3. Working Remotely

- Hybrid work schedules (some days in-person and others at home) are permitted. Fully remote work depends on the nature of job responsibilities.  
- At minimum, hybrid workers must attend weekly lab meetings and other scheduled group meetings in person.  
- Complete the UCSF Telework Agreement to set expectations.  
- Official UCSF teleworking policies can be found [here](https://hr.ucsf.edu/resources/policies/telework).

## B. Communication

- **Email**: Regularly check UCSF email inboxes and respond promptly.  
- When emailing collaborators, CC Jen on the first email; you may move her to BCC afterward.  

**Slack**:  
We use Slack for internal communication.  
- Use shared channels instead of direct messages when troubleshooting tasks.  
- Do not share protected health information (PHI) in Slack. Use Box or secure email for such data.

More about Slack is detailed in [VII-B](#).

## C. Authorship & Publications

The lab follows the ICMJE guidelines for authorship:  
- Use the Contributor Roles Taxonomy (CRediT) system for role transparency.  
- Collaboratively write papers with all involved researchers.  
- Submit manuscripts for internal peer review before publication.  

UCSF MAC authorship guidelines can be found on MACipedia: [Authorship Guidelines](https://wiki.library.ucsf.edu/download/attachments/407113641/Authorship%20Guidelines_10.15.21_final.docx?version=2&modificationDate=1636486867000&api=v2).

## D. Reviewing Manuscripts

Jen may enlist lab members to review manuscripts.  
1. Write a review structured into four sections:
   - Brief summary of the paper.
   - Main issues/concerns/questions (suggest improvements).
   - Minor issues/concerns.
   - Optional notes on typos or formatting issues.
2. Collaborate with a peer for a team review.  
3. Share a finalized draft with Jen for further edits.  

Jen may share peer reviews as references.

## E. Expectations for Mentees

New mentees should discuss expectations with Jen during their first meeting. Topics may include:  
- Frequency and format of meetings.  
- Communication methods and response timeframes.  
- Policies for remote work, vacation, and authorship.  
- Additional expectations from both mentor and mentee.
